                Alphabet Soup! is a typing game where you are given a limited amount of time and a list of random words.
                The goal of the game is to see how many words you can type correctly within that given time.

                In this project, my goal was create a fun, memorable experience using everything I've learned in IGME
                235. My goal with this project was also to familiarize myself with PIXIjs. One challenge I encountered
                with this project was working with the keypress handler. Since most of my code was based off this event,
                I had to be aware of how I went about finding solutions. I had a difficult time structuring the code in
                a way that worked with this event handler.
